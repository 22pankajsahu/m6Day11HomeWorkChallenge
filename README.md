## Demo

Check out the live demo of the Tip Generator application [here](https://22pankajsahu.github.io/m6Day11HomeWorkChallenge/).

## Features

- Generate tips based on bill amount, service quality, and number of people sharing the bill.
- Display the calculated tip amount.

## How it Works

The Tip Generator application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of how each component contributes to the functionality:

### HTML (index.html)

The HTML file sets up the structure of the web page and includes the following elements:

- Input fields for entering the bill amount, selecting service quality, and specifying the number of people sharing the bill.
- A button to calculate the tip.

### CSS (style tag)

The CSS file provides styling to the different elements of the Tip Generator application:

- Styling for the container, input fields, and button is defined to provide a visually pleasing user interface.

### JavaScript (script tag)

The JavaScript file provides the interactivity and functionality of the Tip Generator application:

1. **Event Listener**
   - The `cal` button is set to listen for the `click` event, which triggers when the user clicks the button.

2. **Tip Calculation**
   - When the button is clicked, the event handler retrieves the values entered by the user for bill amount, service quality, and number of people sharing.
   - The tip is calculated based on the formula: `(bill * quality) / sharing`, where `quality` is a multiplier based on the selected service quality.

3. **Display Tip**
   - The calculated tip amount is displayed in the designated `<p>` element.
